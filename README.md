# League of Legends chatbot
This is my first mini project that I have worked on. I have made a chatbot a basic one which runs on if else conditionals, which first asks the user whether they are beginner or experienced at the start and if they are beginner, it gives a breif summary about league of legenda and will prompt the user to select a role. After that it gives beginner friendly champions to play and a site that you can redirect to which will have the  champions details.
If you are an experienced player, it prompts the user to type a champion that they want the details about and will give a site that user can redirect to which contains the respective champions details
